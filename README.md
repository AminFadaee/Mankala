# Mankala
Wow! This was fun!
So, I was assigned to implement the Mankala game (in console) using Java for a job interview I had.
Turns out it's a really fun game!
I don't have enough patience to explain the details of the game so check [the wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala) for that.
Also, if you want to play and practice, [here is a good online version](https://www.mathplayground.com/mancala.html)
